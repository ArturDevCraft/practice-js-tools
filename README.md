# JavaScript: Tools

---

This section helped me set up my work environment and verify the necessary tools.

### [Task 01](./01/)

In task **01**, I once again made repository fork and used basic git commands such as:

- git add
- git clone
- git commit
- git push

I verified the operation of the live server in the vscode environment.

### [Task 02](./02/)

Task **02** is to check the operation of the node.js runtime environment and the npm package installer.

### [Task 03](./03)

Thanks to task 03, I learned about a great tool for creating extensive notes â€” **Obsidian** and I also learned the principles of creating documents in Markdown. I also learned about the idea of creating a **second brain** and organizing notes using PARA method by Tiago Forte.

### [Task 04](./04)

I updated my LinkedIn profile and informed the community about my participation in mentoring.

### [Task 05](./05)

The last thing to do was to make a pull request to submit the tasks for review by the mentor.
